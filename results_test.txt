sample 1:
Sat formula is: Implies(Implies(trainLate & ~taxi, johnLate), Implies(~johnLate, Implies(trainLate, taxi)))

writing cnf formula from sat : (johnLate | taxi | trainLate | ~trainLate) & (johnLate | taxi | ~johnLate | ~trainLate) & (johnLate | taxi | ~taxi | ~trainLate)
dimac structure of the sat is [[1, 2, 3, -3], [1, 2, -1, -3], [1, 2, -2, -3]]

sample 2:
Sat formula is: (A | B) & (A | C) & (C | ~B) & (~A | ~B)

writing cnf formula from sat : (A | B) & (A | C) & (C | ~B) & (~A | ~B)
dimac structure of the sat is [[3, 2], [3, 1], [1, -2], [-3, -2]]
